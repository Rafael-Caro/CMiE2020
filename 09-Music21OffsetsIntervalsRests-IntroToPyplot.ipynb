In the particular case of the dataset from which our score is taken, the [Jingju Music Scores Collection](https://zenodo.org/record/1464653), the machine reable scores are accompanied by a spreadsheet containing information about the starting and ending offsets of all the lines and line sections for all the scores of the dataset, including descriptions of the musical features of each line and section.

Within **Matplotlib**, **pyplot** arguably is the most commonly used collection of functions for the creation of plots. In the following cells, an introductory glimpse to **pyplot** is offered.\n",
